Q.	What is an IP address ?
A-	Internet Protocol address, number unique to each device connected to a
	computer network. Two main fonction: host or network interface
	identification and location adressing.

Q.	What is a subnet mask ?
A-	Tell wich portion of the IP is host and wich is network:
	if ip:		195.	68.		3.		4
	mask:		255.	255.	255.	0
	network:	195.	68.		3.		0

Q.	What is a broadcast address ?
A-	A network adress used to communicated with all device connected to host
	if ip:		195.	68.		3.		4
	mask:		255.	255.	255.	0
	broadcast:	195.	68.		3.		255

Q.	What's the difference between public and private IP address ?
A-	Private IP address and public IP address are used to uniquely identify a
	machine on the internet.
	Private IP address is used with a local network and public IP address is
	used outside the network.
	Public IP address is provided by ISP, internet Service Provider.
	Some diff:
	Private:					Public:
	free						has a cost
	10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255	Except private IP, rest IP is public.
	172.16.0.0 to	"
	192.168.0.0 to	"
	Example:					Example:
	192.168.11.50				17.5.7.8

Q.	What are the different class of IP ?
A-	Class A:
	Range:	1.0.0.0		to	126.0.0.0
	Class B:
	Range:	128.0.0.0	to	191.255.0.0
	Class C:
	Range:	192.0.0.0	to	223.225.225.0
	Class D: used for multicasting
	Range:	224.0.0.0	to	239.255.255.255
	Class E: used for reseach purposes
	range:	240.0.0.0	to	255.255.255.255

Q.	What is TCP ?
A-	Transmission Control Protocol, located in the Trasnport layer, it make
	package of data and send it to the IP where it is reassemble to be used.

Q.	What is UDP ?
A-	Same as TCP but faster, often use for vid√©o game

Q.	What are the different layer of network ?
A-	1.	Application:	End user layer:			HTTP, SSH, DNS
	2.	Presentation:	Syntax layer:			IMAP, SSH, JPEG
	3.	Session:		Synch and send to port:	API's, Sockets, WinSock
	4.	Transport:		End-to-end connection:	TCP, UDP
	5.	Network:		Packets:				IP, ICMP
	6.	Data link:		Frames:					Ethernet, PPP, Switch, Bridge
	7.	Physical:		Physical structure:		Fiber, Wireless, Repeater

Q.	What is the OSI model ?
A-	Open System Interconnection, the thing with 7 layers, ^

Q.	What is the purpose of a DHCP server ?
A-	A DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network
	configuration parameters to each device on a network so they can
	communicate with other IP networks. DHCP is and enhancement of an
	older protcol called BOOTP. DHCP is an importatn part of the DDI
	solution: (DNS-DHCP-IPAM)

Q.	What is the purpose of DNS server ?
A-	It translate names into IP address:
	https://www.google.com = xxxxx (I don't find it, but DNS server of
	google are 8.8.8.8)
	It alse provides a list of mail servers which accept emails for each
	domain name.

Q.	What are the minium configuration to make comunication between
	2 device using IP address ?
A-	Each device on an IP network requires 3 different pieces of information
	in order to correctly communicate with other devices on the network:
	an IP address, a subnet mask, and a broadcast address.

Q.	How IP routing work ?
A-	It work thanks to table and routing protocol. Routing is the process
	of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across
	multiple networks.
	To look futher more, search for OSPF, link state, static + dynamic
	routing
